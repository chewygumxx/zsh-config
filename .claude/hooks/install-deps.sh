# SessionStart. Installs this repository's dependencies, with Bun, so husky's
# git hooks are wired before anything else in the session runs.
#
# A cloud session starts from a bare clone: `core.hooksPath` is unset until
# something runs `bun install`, since that is what invokes
# husky's own `prepare` script. Until then `commit-msg` and
# `.husky/pre-commit` never fire, so a commit made early in a session
# silently skips commitlint and every formatter/linter/test gate, and
# nothing reports it. Established by hitting exactly this, by hand, in a
# session before this hook existed.
#
# Remote-only: a local checkout already has a real development setup, and
# re-running this on every editor-attached session would only add latency
# for no benefit.
#
# `bun install`, not `bun install --frozen-lockfile`: this hook runs on every
# session start (`startup`, `resume`, `clear` and `compact` alike), and a
# lockfile that has drifted from `package.json` should not leave a session
# with no hooks at all. Either way Bun reuses container-cached
# `node_modules` instead of rebuilding it from nothing every time. It is
# genuinely idempotent here: no dependency is patched and `package.json` has
# no `postinstall` (the commitizen prompt's titles come from
# `@chewygumxx/cz-commitlint`). Verified by probe: a clean `bun install`
# reproduces `bun.lock` byte-for-byte against what is committed, both from
# nothing and repeated on top of itself.
#
# Scoped to Bun on purpose. `mise install` cannot run here: this
# environment's network policy blocks mise's own download hosts, so the
# gate binaries `.mise.toml` pins (actionlint, shuck, and yamllint with the
# uv that installs it) stay unavailable regardless of what this hook does.
# That gap belongs to the environment's network policy, not to a
# repository-committed hook.
